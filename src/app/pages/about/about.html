      <p>
        I am a Software Developer with hands-on experience in building web
        applications using Angular, Node.js, and MS SQL Server. I focus on
        developing clean, scalable, and maintainable solutions that align with
        real-world business requirements.

        My professional journey began in Technical Recruitment, where I worked
        closely with engineering teams, hiring managers, and stakeholders. This
        experience gave me a strong understanding of software development
        lifecycles, enterprise workflows, and the importance of building systems
        that solve practical problems.

        Over time, my interest in application development grew stronger, leading
        me to transition into a software development role. Currently, I work on
        mid-level applications, contributing across both frontend and backend
        development. I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces, implementing
        robust backend logic, and continuously improving my technical skill set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based in Vadodara, India, I am open to global opportunities and
        relocation, including roles in Canada. I am motivated to work on
        challenging projects that encourage learning, innovation, and mutual
        professional growth.
